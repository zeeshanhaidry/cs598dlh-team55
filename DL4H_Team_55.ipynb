        "Obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea syndrome (OSAHS) is a breathing disorder where breathing is obstructed while sleeping (Loughlin Et al, 1996). Sleep apnea affects 1%-5% of children in the United States and can lead to other health illnesses if left untreated (Loughlin Et al, 1996; Marcus et al, 2012). Currently, at-home diagnostic tools for sleep apnea are only available for adults, leaving room for models to be created to address the needs for children (Fayyaz et al, 2023). The current state-of-the-art sleep apnea detection models created for adults (CNN (Chang et al., 2020), SE-MSCNN (Chen et al., 2022), CNN+LSTM (Zarei et al., 2022), Hybrid Transformer (Hu et al., 2022)) are effective but cannot be used for children because the sleep data differs between the two, and OSAHS symptoms for children require more attention (Choi et al, 2010; Gipson et al, 2019).\n",
        "\n",
        "Polysomnography is commonly used to diagnose OSAHS. This process is used to collect various signals while sleeping such as brain activity (EEG), eye movement (EOG), heart rhythm (ECG), blood oxygen saturation (SpO2), blood CO2 levels (ETCO2), and air flow. Although polysomnography is the best method to diagnose OSAHS, it is complex, costly, intrusive, and requires clinician involvement (Spielmanns et al, 2019). Because of these issues, it is not easy for children and their families to use polysomnography to detect OSAHS at home. To address these issues, Fayyaz et al. propose a transformer-based model to help detect OSAHS in children.  Additionally, they compared using all the available polysomnography modalities to only a subset of the available modalities in the model, which is important because a subset of modalities may be significantly easier to collect at home, so finding if a subset performs as well as all polysomnography modalities data increases the feasibility of at-home detection. In terms of metrics, the proposed transformer-based model outperforms the current state-of-the-art sleep apnea detection models, and an additional edge of factoring demographic data into the modalities improves the proposed model’s performance even further.\n",

The multi-head attention will consist of concatenated attention heads and a final fully connected layer to facilitate the model’s ability to focus on information across various representation sub-spaces. In terms of the position-wise feed- forward network, it will be comprised of one fully connected layer followed by a ReLU activation unit and then another fully connected layer.

        "After looking through all the individual components of the original paper, we conclude that the paper is reproducible. Our current model performance might not be the same as what the original paper shows because we currently only processed a small subset of the data, however we are confident that once we utilize all the data available, we can achieve the same results as what is described in the original paper.\n",

        "The overall experience of reproducing the paper was satisfying as it had sections that were easy as well as difficult. The easiest section was understanding the overall flow of data throughout the high-level overview of the model. However, the actual implementation of the model was difficult because there were practical decisions that needed to be made. One such decision was where to store the data for easy use of preprocessing, training, and testing; we decided to upload all data to a Box account due to its ability to store large sizes of data and allow for easy connection and retrieval of data for machine learning tasks. Another difficult decision was determining resources that could be used to handle all the machine learning operations; Google Colab is currently being used, however if higher computational resources are needed we may utilize the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign’s campus research computing resources. One final difficult decision was whether we should utilize the same functions provided in the original paper’s GitHub; we decided that we could not use the same functions exactly as they were given but instead made some slight modifications to be able to work with our setup. In the process of reproducing the original paper, several helper functions needed to be implemented and many version-specific code libraries were utilized. In the future, these helper functions being available and explicit indications of the versions of libraries used will help improve reproducibility and allow individuals to focus more time on advancing the model and seeing better results.\n",
