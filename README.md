To quickly get started with running our notebook, you may use the free Google Colab environment.
 1.First, download the .ipynb file in this Git repo locally to your computer.
 2. Then navigate to Google Colab (https://colab.research.google.com/), signing into your personal Google account.
 3. Click Upload -> Browse and upload the .ipynb file you downloaded in step 1.
Once you have the notebook opened, please execute each cell starting from the beginning.
You must first install all the python dependencies.
Then, to go to the point of loading the pre-trained model (Section: Preprocessing command to download data from Box to local Colab Drive storage to get the data for further use in the notebook), run the cell under this section that will use gdown to get the trained model into your local workspace.
After that point, you may use the model to run tests, assuming you have access to the CHAT dataset files (which can be requested from the sleepdata.org portal)
Moreover, once you have the sleep CHAT data, you can also run preprocessing steps and training on your end, if you so wish.
